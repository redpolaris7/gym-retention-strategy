# gym-retention-strategy
Hello, today my task is going to be to analyze Model Fitness's customer profiles and come up with a customer retention strategy. 

One of the most common problems gyms and other services face is customer churn. How do we know if a customer is no longer with us? We can calculate churn based on people who get rid of their accounts or don't renew their contracts. However, sometimes it's not obvious that a client has left: they may walk out on tiptoes.

Churn indicators vary from field to field. If a user buys from an online store rarely but regularly, we can't say they're a runaway. But if for two weeks they haven't opened a channel that's updated daily, that's a reason to worry: our follower might have gotten bored and left us.

For a gym, it makes sense to say a customer has left if they don't come for a month. Of course, it's possible they're in Cancun and will resume their visits when they return, but's that's not a typical case. Usually, if a customer joins, comes a few times, then disappears, they're unlikely to come back.

Here's the tasks for this project:

- Learn to predict the probability of churn (for the upcoming month) for each customer;
- Draw up typical user portraits: select the most outstanding groups and describe their main features;
- Analyze the factors that impact churn most;
- Draw basic conclusions and develop recommendations on how to improve customer service:
  - Identify target groups;
  - Suggest measures to cut churn;
  - Describe any other patterns you see with respect to interaction with customers.
